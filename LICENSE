## 1. License Grant

Subject to the conditions below, the Licensor (Matthew Combatti) grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to:

**a.** Use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (CrossBasic) and its associated documentation files **non-commercially**, provided that your use, modification, and distribution do not involve directly or substantially indirectly selling, commercializing, or monetizing this software (CrossBasic) or any derivative that includes portions of CrossBasic’s source code.

**b.** Use CrossBasic freely to develop and distribute your own software applications, projects, and related products, which may themselves be sold, licensed, or commercialized without restriction—**provided they do not redistribute, embed, or repackage CrossBasic’s source or compiled binaries in a way that makes CrossBasic a substantial or primary component of the commercial product.** For avoidance of doubt, CrossBasic may not constitute more than 50% of the value, functionality, or code base of the commercial product.

**c.** Include compiled CrossBasic runtime binaries, plugins, or embedded components with your application for runtime use **as long as CrossBasic is not the core feature or bulk of your product** (i.e., your product offers significant value independently of CrossBasic).

**a.** Fork, copy, distribute, sublicense, host, or resell CrossBasic or any of its components directly for profit (see Section 1.b).

**b.** Offer commercial hosting, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), or any paid service that provides public access to CrossBasic’s runtime, binaries, or source code—**unless** you have obtained prior written permission from the Licensor.
*This restriction does not apply to internal use within an organization where CrossBasic is used privately and not exposed to customers or the public.*

**c.** Create, distribute, or sell any derivative that consists primarily of CrossBasic’s source code or compiled binaries, whether in original or modified form, without a separate commercial license.

Then you must obtain a commercial license from the Licensor.
