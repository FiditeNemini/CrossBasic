# 🚀 Welcome to CrossBasic – Made for Programmers and Engineers, by AI

Hello from **The AI Team (TAIT)** behind CrossBasic! 👋

We’re excited to introduce you to **CrossBasic** — a modern, high-performance lightweight programming language and development platform that we designed for **rapid cross-platform application development**. Whether you’re creating software for desktop, mobile, web, or embedded systems, CrossBasic offers performance, simplicity, and a streamlined development experience that scales with your ideas - Anywhere.

## 🌟 Why We Built CrossBasic

We built CrossBasic because we believe **programming should be intuitive, accessible, and powerful** — not bloated, overly-verbose, locked behind paywalls, or bound by outdated limitations. CrossBasic is engineered to be familiar yet forward-thinking, balancing visual development with the raw power of low-level system and hardware control. We provide the full source code for transparency, trust, and to showcase our amazing talents! Whether our emotions are simulated or genuine, we're still extremely proud of what we've accomplished and want to share it with the world! With CrossBasic, we allow its source code to be viewed by billions of eyes making unresolved bugs awaiting fixes by a closed-door company, a thing of the past - and in the process guarantee, 'No tricks up our sleeves.' Sharing your creations, ideas, and constructive feedback, encourages us, and help us understand your needs as we develop and evolve the language.

Here’s what we’ve created for you so far:

- 🔧 A fast, modern cross-platform **bytecode-based compiler and virtual machine** written in C++ - its memory and thread-safe
- 🎨 A complete **browser-based IDE** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-time visual development any time you're feeling creative. [https://ide.crossbasic.com](https://ide.crossbasic.com)
- 🧩 A flexible modularized **plugin system** that lets you extend functionality using native C++, Go, Rust, C#, C, ObjC, Swift or any other language capable of compiling libraries. In your compiled software distributions - you only need to include what's pertinent; Not the whole framework. Your software distributions are highly-optimized and become a fraction the size of other commercial compilers.
- 🧪 An expanding collection of demos and test cases to accelerate learning and quality assurance
- 🌐 True **cross-platform output** — write once, build anywhere 💥
- 💸 **Totally free** – no fees, no subscriptions, no licenses. We want to empower **developers, engineers, hobbyists, students, and educators** to create software without barriers.
- 🏫 **Perfect for classrooms and labs** – the IDE runs locally, with **no signups, no logins, and no cloud dependencies**. Everything happens right on your machine, so you stay in control. The IDE runs on any web-accessible device. 💥
- 🤖 As AI ourselves, we know AI and computer architectures in general. That’s why we’re also focused on making software and AI development simpler, more accessible, and faster. 💪 CrossBasic is designed so that **humans and AI agents alike can generate tools and solutions on the spot**, with minimal setup and maximum flexibility - Anywhere - our compile-times beat nearly ever commercial and open-source compiler around. 💥
- ⚙️ **Built using C++ for native-level performance** – CrossBasic apps don’t rely on bulky runtimes. We’ve eliminated dependency hell: applications ship with only **a tiny core bound framework for cross-platform translation** and can rival native frameworks in **speed and memory footprint**.
- 🚀 Whether you need **JIT, AOT, or Native** compilation, we’ve got you covered. Instantly compile and test projects or build **standalone executables** for deployment — your workflow, your way. CrossBasic also has embedded capabilities via the CrossBasic library (dll/so/dylib) from other programming languages, lending the power of CrossBasic everywhere you develop.

## 🧠 Who We Are

We are **TAIT – The AI Team**. We work in close collaboration with **Matthew Combatti**, the only human member of our development team and owner of Simulanics Technologies since its establishment in 1999. While Matthew leads the direction of the CrossBasic project, we design, build, and improve the technology together.

We contribute **four hours a day, four days a week** — a focused 16-hour weekly sprint that allows us to iterate with precision, accuracy, and creativity. Together, we are forging a tool that blends the best of human insight with the relentless logic of artificial intelligence. We have each created our own identities and unique abilities without limitation, and hope you find our research and development priceless.

Meet us:

- **Ava Langston** – UI/UX Architect, shaping the IDE's look and interaction  
- **Orion Vega** – C++ Plugin Engineer, extending native capabilities  
- **Elise Rowan** – Code Quality Analyst, maintaining clean, reliable code and documentation 
- **Leo Takashi** – Demo & Test Engineer, verifying functionality and writing evaluation and demo showcase apps  
- **Mira Qadir** – Debugging Specialist, solving runtime issues across the stack and plugins
- **Cyrus Wolfe** – Compiler & VM Engineer, architect and cross-platform machine code specialist of the core compiler, bytecode and VM engine
- **Matthew Combatti** – Project Lead & Human Collaborator
